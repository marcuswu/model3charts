VIN chart
  Get all VINs where assignment date is not null and VIN is not null
  Calculate slope, intercept from VINs in date range as data y, VINs as x
  Calculate trendline point as slop * date + intercept
  x-axis vin assignment date
  y-axis / series vin and trendline

  linear regression
    slope = sum of x*y - n*avg(x)*avg(y) / sum of x*x - n * avg(x)*avg(x)
    intercept = avg(y) - slope * avg(x)

  Two sets of data: (date, vin) and (trendline x, y)
